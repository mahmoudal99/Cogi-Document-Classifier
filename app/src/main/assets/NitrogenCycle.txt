Dentrification
NO3 (nitrate) becomes N2 (gas) and goes into atmosphere


Nitrification
NO2 (nitrate) becomes NO3 (nitrate), usable by plants


Nitrogen Fixation
N2 (gas) becomes NO2 (nitrate) and can be taken in by plants


Ammonification
Waste/urine and dead organic matter converted from NH3 (ammonia) into NH4 (also converts N2 to NH4)


Legumes
plant organisms involved in getting nitrogen gas into NO3 (have root modules with bacteria that do the job)


Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria
Organisms in a mutual relationship with the plants above in getting nitrogen into a usable form

Bacteria
kind of organisms in the soil involved in every step of the nitrogen cycle, named after their particular task


Decomposer
major niche of organisms that are involved in every step of the nitrogen cycle


Assimilation
how the animals get nitrogen
